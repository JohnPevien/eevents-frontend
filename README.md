# About

An app for finding for online and in person events built with NextJS, Tailwind and Strapi

# Frontend

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Quick Start ‚ö°

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## About the Project üí≠

A next JS partnered with strapi for backend. This project is based from [Next.js Dev to Deployment](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-dev-to-deployment/) with my own touch of modifications.

## Modifications ‚öôÔ∏è

- Use tailwind css
- Use TypeScript

### But why? ü§î

1. I want to practice the usage of tailwind.
2. Since using TypeScript and seeing it's advantages over the JavaScript, I want to use TypeScript all the time wherever I have the freedom to use it.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
